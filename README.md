Custom Angular Seed
===================

Just an update to the angular-seed project the angular team assembled with a little scripting to get started.

Setup
-------------------

To run tests using the Karma test runner, you'll need node and npm. 

 - Run the install.sh script found in the scripts directory.
 - After npm and node have been installed, 'cd' into the project directory and run npm install. This will pull down any project dependencies specified in the package.json file and place them in the folder node_modules.
 - After running 'npm install', run './scripts/test.sh' and Karma will start up.
 - To host the application, run './scripts/webserver.js' and then navigate to localhost:8000/app/angular_poc.html
